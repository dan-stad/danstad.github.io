Welcome! I am PhD candidate in Economics at Rice University. My research lies in the intersection between applied industrial organization and education economics, with development economics.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  The role of aspirations in facilitating movement out of poverty is a subject of increasing research in development economics. Previous work finds positive impacts from international child sponsorship on educational attainment, employment, and adult income. This paper seeks to ascertain whether the impacts of child sponsorship on educational outcomes may occur through elevated aspirations among sponsored children. Using an age-eligibility rule applied during program rollout to identify causal effects, we study whether international child sponsorship increases educational and vocational aspirations among a sample of 2,022 children in Kenya, Indonesia, and Mexico. While effects are heterogeneous, and strongest in Kenya, we find that, averaging over the three countries, sponsorship increased indices of self-esteem (0.25_&sigma), optimism (0.26$\sigma$), aspirations (0.29$\sigma$), and expected years of completed education (0.43 years). We find that sponsorship increases actual grade completion by 0.56 among children at the time of the survey, and mediation analysis suggests that the impact of sponsorship on aspirations is likely to mediate higher levels of grade completion. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that the positive impacts of child sponsorship stem partly through elevating aspirations. More generally, our research contributes to a larger literature suggesting that the alleviation of internal constraints among the poor is a strong complement to addressing their external constraints.

 * [International Child Sponsorship Impact on the Intended Choice of Acquiring a Higher Education Degree: the Case of Rural Mexico.](http://academicpages.github.io/files/WP_aspirations2_DP.pdf) (_Submitted_)

 <summary>Abstract</summary>
        This paper studies the impact of a child sponsorship program on the aspiration to acquire a higher education degree, among a sample of rural children in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas in the south of Mexico. To account for the program's selection of the children, we estimate a binary Roy type model with unobservables generated by a one-factor structure. We use both scripted survey questions to elicit the subjective expected returns to schooling, and estimates from prior research on causality methods accounting for the endogeneity of treatment, to estimate the sponsorship effect on the revealed intended opportunity of acquiring a technical degree or university studies. We find that the average treatment effects on the treated are positive and consistent with previous studies of the sponsorship program, although they are not statistically significant. Estimates of the marginal treatment effect show that the sponsorship effect is higher for the children most likely to be selected for the program. From the subjective expectations data, I document that children in rural settings, 12 to 15 years old, have realistic although heterogeneous expectations, and we find a clear gender gap in earnings expectations, even at these young ages.

## Work in Progress 

* Whose opinion matters most for the choice of major? The relative influence of parents, teachers and peers.
* Studentsâ€™ willingness to pay for university attributes.
